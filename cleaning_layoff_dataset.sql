# First let's check for duplicates

-- 2. Standardize Data

SELECT *

-- if we look at industry it looks like we have some null and empty rows, let's take a look at these

WHERE company='Appsmith';

SELECT *

ORDER BY industry;



-- we should set the blanks to nulls since those are typically easier to work with
UPDATE world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
SET industry = NULL
WHERE industry = '';

-- now if we check those are all null

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;

-- now we need to populate those nulls if possible

UPDATE layoffs_staging2 t1
JOIN layoffs_staging2 t2
ON t1.company = t2.company
SET t1.industry = t2.industry
WHERE t1.industry IS NULL
AND t2.industry IS NOT NULL;

-- and if we check it looks like Appsmith's was the only one without a populated row to populate this null values
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;


-- --------------------------------------------------
-- we also need to look at 

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

-- everything looks good except apparently we have some "United States" and some "United States." with a period at the end. Let's standardize this.
SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY country;

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET country = TRIM(TRAILING '.' FROM country);

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET company = TRIM(company);

-- Let's also fix the date columns:
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

-- we can use str to date to update this field
UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET `date` = STR_TO_DATE(`date`, '%Y-%m-%d');


ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
MODIFY COLUMN `total_laid_off` int;

-- now we can convert the data type properly
ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
MODIFY COLUMN `date` DATE;

-- 3. Look at Null Values

-- the null values in total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, and funds_raised_millions all look normal. I don't think I want to change that

-- 4. remove any columns and rows we need to

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off ='';

UPDATE world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
SET total_laid_off = NULL
WHERE total_laid_off = '';

UPDATE world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
SET percentage_laid_off = NULL
WHERE percentage_laid_off = '';

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

-- Delete Useless data we can't really use
DELETE FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

SELECT * 
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
DROP COLUMN row_num;

SELECT *
